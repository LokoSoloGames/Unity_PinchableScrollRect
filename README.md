## Features
* Customizable pinching behaviour with inherited Unity ScrollRect behaviour.
* Overridden OnScroll behaviour for mouse scroll to perform zooming behaviour.
* Customized pinching gesture to perform the same zooming behaviour as mouse scroll input for touches.
* Transformed standard Unity Event IPointerUp & IPointerDown interface into IPinch interface for further customization of touch behaviour

## Getting Started
* Use it same as the way you use the Unity ScrollRect component.
* Add a UI/ScrollView from the GameObject Menu
* Select the ScrollRect added, click on the context dropdown menu
* Select "Replace as Pinchable"

## Important Remarks
* PinchInputDetector component must have a higher execution order than PinchableScrollRect component or any IPinchHandler component in order to consume the original OnDrag pointer event beforehand.
* Without PinchInputDetector, the ScrollRect can still perform zooming with mouse scroll input but not touch input.
* The absolute minimum scale of the Content of the ScrollRect is 1. A customizable lower bound and upper bound of the scale can be set on inspector.
* Any third touches detected after pinching will be ignore, even after both pinching touches are lifted.
* Editor script is needed in order to serialize the extra fields added to the PinchableScrollRect component.
